            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on
                traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and
                Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic
                and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to
                pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and
                his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort
                to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean
                region.
